# Node, Express, Mongoose, Require, Backbone, Marionette Project

I pigged back off of https://github.com/scotch-io/easy-node-authentication

This repo uses passport for user authentication.

I've built a commenting wall, and I am still adding more features to this project.

If you wish to view it, pull the repo down, make sure you have MongoDB installed and running.
Run npm install and node server.js at the project root and the magic should happen at port 5000
Like I said I am still adding on to the project.
